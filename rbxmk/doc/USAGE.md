## Command options

Since almost all actions are done in Lua, the `rbxmk` command has only a few
options:

```
rbxmk [ -h ] [ -f FILE ] [ ARGS... ]
```

Options          | Description
-----------------|------------
`-h`, `--help`   | Display a help message.
`-f`, `--file`   | Run a Lua script from a file.

If the `-f` option is not given, then the script is read from stdin.

Options after any valid flags will be passed to the script as arguments.
Numbers, bools, and nil are parsed into their respective types in Lua, and any
other values are read as strings.

```shell
rbxmk -f script.lua hello world 123
```

A script can read these arguments with the `...` operator.

```lua
Arg1, Arg2, Arg3 = ... -- "hello", "world", 123
AllArgs = {...}
```

## Lua environment

[Lua](https://lua.org) scripts are used to perform actions. Scripts are run in
a stripped-down environment; none of the regular base functions and libraries
are loaded. Instead, a set of new functions is made available.

Each function accepts a table as its only argument. Lua has the following bit
of syntax sugar to support this: if a constructed table is the only argument
to a function, then the function's parentheses may be omitted:

```lua
func({arg1, arg2})
func{arg1, arg2}
-- Both calls are equivalent
```

Henceforth, an "argument", in the context of these Lua functions, will refer
to a value within this kind of table.

Because of how tables work, there can be two kinds of arguments: named and
unnamed.

```lua
-- Unnamed arguments
func{value, value}

-- Named arguments
func{arg1=value, arg2=value}
```

## Workflow


The primary functions used in every script are the `input`, `output`, and
`map` functions.

The `input` and `output` functions each refer to some piece of **data**,
returning a representation of the data.

```lua
input_data = input{reference...}
output_data = output{reference...}
```

Data is retrieved from some location referred to by the arguments of each
function. In the case of `output`, the returned value is a reference that
merely points to the data, which can be resolved at a later time.

The `map` function receives a number of inputs and a number of outputs, then
maps each input to each output.

```lua
map{input_data, output_data}
```

At this point, the output reference is resolved, then merged with the input
data. Finally, the results are written back to the location referred to by the
output reference.

*A less friendly, more detailed description of how this process works is
available in [DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md#resolve-chain).*

## References

A **reference** is a list of strings that specify a location to read data from
(in the case of `input`), or to write data to (in the case of `output`).
Usually, each successive string specifies a piece of data within the data
referred to by the previous string.

For example, the first string can refer to the location of a file in the file
system. Depending on the format of the file, the next string in the reference
will **drill** down into the file, selecting a piece of data within it.

```lua
input_source = input{"Documents/Roblox/place.rbxl", "Workspace.Model.Part.Script", "Source"}
```

This example selects the "place.rbxl" file, then drills into this `rbxl` file
to select a Script instance, then drills into the Script to select its
"Source" property. The `input_source` variable now contains the Source
property's value, which is a string.

The same procedure applies to outputs, except that they refer to the location
where data will be written to. For example, we can select another script in
another file, and write `input_source` to there.

```lua
output_source = output{"another_place.rbxlx", "ServerScriptService.ModuleScript", "Source"}
map{input_source, output_source}
```

In this example, mapping `input_source` to the output causes the file to be
rewritten to include the source at the specified location. The following steps
describe what happens:

1. Read the content of "another_place.rbxlx", represented as a tree of
   instances.
2. Drill into the tree to the specified location (the Source property of a
   ModuleScript).
3. Merge `input_source` into the location (merging a string into a string simply
   overwrites one with the other).
4. Write the entire tree (with the modifications) back to the file.

## Schemes

The first string of a Reference is always a URI. It begins with a scheme
(`scheme-name://`), which specifies the type of resource being identified. The
remainder of the URI depends on the scheme. Here are a few of them:

- `file://`: The URI is a path to a file on the file system.
- `http://`: The URI is regular URL referring to a web resource.
- `generate://`: The URI specifies the type of value to be generated. The next
  string in the reference defines the value itself.

As this list suggests, while most schemes deal primarily with the first string
of the reference, some schemes may process more than one. Some schemes may
also be defined only for inputs or outputs. For example, the "generate" scheme
cannot be used as an output.

Since the file scheme is the most commonly used, the scheme portion of its URI
can be omitted.

```lua
-- These two are equivalent.
place = input{"Documents/Roblox/place.rbxl"}
place = input{"file://Documents/Roblox/place.rbxl"}
```

A complete list of schemes and how they work can be found in
[DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md#user-content-schemes).

## Formats

Once the scheme has been resolved, we are left with the raw data retrieved
from the resource. This isn't very useful on its own, so the raw data is
processed further by using a **format**. A format defines how to decode raw
data into **data** of a known type that is easier to handle. It also defines
how to encode data.

Some schemes are able to guess the format, others require it to be specified
explicitly. Some don't require a format at all.

The `input` and `output` functions have a named argument called `format`. When
specified, it will override whatever format is guessed by the scheme.

```lua
-- Read a regular Lua file as a ModuleScript Lua file.
script = input{format="modulescript.lua", "file.lua"}
```
```lua
map{
	-- The http scheme cannot guess the format, so it must be provided by the
	-- user.
	output{format="rbxl", "https://www.roblox.com/Data/Upload.aspx?assetid=1818"},
	input{"crossroads.rbxl"},
}
```
```lua
-- The generate scheme does not require a format, because no raw data needs to
-- be decoded.
props = input{format="properties.json", "generate://Property", "Size:Vector3=4,1,2;Anchored=true"}
```

Here is a selection from the many available formats:

- `rbxl`: A Roblox place file.
- `rbxmx`: A Roblox model file in XML format.
- `lua`: An untyped Lua file.
- `script.lua`: A Lua file decoded into a Script instance.
- `properties.json`: A list of property name-value pairs.

A complete list of formats and how they work can be found in
[DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md#user-content-formats).

## Data types

After a format has decoded the raw data, it returns typed data that rbxmk
knows how to handle. Here are some examples of the types returned by several
formats:

Format            | Data Type    | Description
------------------|--------------|------------
`rbxl`            | `Instances`  | A list of instances.
`lua`             | `Stringlike` | A string.
`properties.json` | `Properties` | A table of property name-value pairs.

The power of a type is that it can be **drilled** into. As previously
mentioned, a `rbxl` file can be drilled into to select a single Instance. What
this really means is that `rbxl` returns an `Instances` type, which returns an
`Instance` type when it is drilled into. This `Instance` type can also be
drilled into, to select a `Property` type. Depending on the value, even this
can be drilled further.

Here's a list of several types and how they can be drilled into:

Input type   | Output type  | Reference
-------------|--------------|----------
`Instances`  | `Instance`   | A dot-separated list of names, with each successive name selecting the child of the previous.
`Instance`   | `Property`   | The name of a property within the instance.
`Instance`   | `Properties` | A `*` character, which selects all properties in the instance.
`Properties` | `Property`   | The name of a property in the table.

Examples:
```lua
-- Instances -> Instance -> Property
input{"place.rbxl", "Workspace.Model.Part", "Anchored"}

-- Instances -> Instance -> Properties -> Property
input{"place.rbxl", "Workspace.Model.Part", "*", "Size"}

-- Properties -> Property
input{"workspace.properties.json", "FilteringEnabled"}
```

A complete list of types and how they work can be found in
[DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md#user-content-data-types).

## Functions

There are a handful of other functions beside `input`, `output`, and `map`.

### Filters

The `filter` function is used to transform values in some way. The first
argument is a string specifying the name of the filter to use. The remaining
arguments, as well as the return values, depend on the selected filter.

For example, the "minify" filter receives a value and, assuming it's the
source of a Lua script, minifies the content, returning the modified value.

```lua
script = input{"generate://Instance", [[
	Script{
		Name:string = "Script";
		Source:string = "
			for i = 1, 10 do
				print(i)
			end
		";
	}
]]}
script = filter{"minify", script}
-- Value of Source is now "for a=1,10 do print(a)end"
```

A complete list of filters and how they work can be found in
[DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md#user-content-filters).

### Path

The `path` function is used to join file paths, adding separators as needed.

```lua
projects = "C:/Users/John/Documents/Roblox"
project_name = "Crossroads"
place_name = "crossroads.rbxl"
result = path{projects, project_name, place_name}
-- "C:\Users\John\Documents\Roblox\Crossroads\crossroads.rbxl"
```

`path` also recognizes several variables that will be expanded when they are
included somewhere in an argument.

- `$script_directory`: Expands to the directory of the script currently running.
- `$script_name`: Expands to the base name of the script currently running.
- `$working_directory`: Expands to the current working directory.

```lua
-- Get place file in same directory as running script.
place = input{path{"$script_directory/place.rbxl"}}

-- These are technically the same.
place = input{path{"$working_directory/place.rbxl"}}
place = input{path{"place.rbxl"}}
```

### Loading

The `load` function allows you to run other scripts from within a script. The
first argument is the path to the script file. Remaining arguments are passed
to the script, which can be received with the `...` operator. Any values
returned by the script are returned by `load`.

```lua
-- template.lua: Make a template.
local template_type = ...
if template_type == "Part" then
	template = input{"generate://Instance", [[
		Part{
			Name:string = "Part";
			Anchored:bool = true;
			Position:Vector3 = 0,0,0;
			Size:Vector3 = 4,1,2;
		}
	]]}
elseif template_type == "Folder" then
	template = input{"generate://Instance", [[
		Folder{Name:string = "Folder"}
	]]}
end
return template
```

```lua
-- Create some templates.
part   = load{"template.lua", "Part"}
folder = load{"template.lua", "Folder"}
```

### Deletion

Sometimes you may want to remove a value instead of replacing or adding to it.
This can be accomplished with the `delete` function. This function receives
one or more outputs, each of which will be removed.

```lua
-- Remove Position property from a Part instance.
delete{output{"place.rbxl", "Workspace.Model.Part", "Position"}}

-- Remove a Part instance.
delete{output{"place.rbxl", "Workspace.Model.Part"}}

-- Remove all instances in the file.
delete{output{"place.rbxl"}}
```

Note that, when deleting an output that points to an entire file, the file
itself will not be removed. It will still exist, and its content will be the
result of the file's format encoding zero values.
